           data-description="Ecobite is an AI-powered web application created to fight food waste by offering users personalized storage tips, recipe suggestions based on leftover ingredients, and timely expiration alerts. In addition to helping households minimize waste, the platform empowers restaurants to donate surplus food. By entering a location, restaurants trigger an integrated Google Maps API that identifies nearby orphanages for potential food donations. The system’s features include dynamic recipe recommendations, real-time waste reduction insights, and an automated donation locator. The development emphasizes a continuous deployment approach to keep the recipe database current and refine AI suggestions based on seasonal ingredients and user feedback. The architecture is layered into a responsive user interaction front-end, a back-end processing layer using AI models for recipe and expiry predictions, and a robust database layer for storing recipes and user data. The project also implements a CI/CD pipeline with continuous integration, testing (using tools like Selenium and pytest), containerization (via Docker), and performance monitoring (using Prometheus and Grafana)."
